# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Mr Sleep is a pure SwiftUI iOS app that calculates optimal wake-up times based on sleep cycle science. The app uses 90-minute sleep cycles and accounts for 15 minutes to fall asleep.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Approval Required Before Any Changes

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW**: Before making ANY changes to this codebase, Claude MUST:

1. **Explain exactly what will be done** - Describe the specific changes, files to be modified, and the reasoning
2. **Wait for explicit user approval** - Do not proceed until the user confirms with "yes" or similar approval
3. **Apply to ALL changes** - This includes:
   - Code modifications
   - File creation/deletion
   - Configuration changes
   - Documentation updates
   - Git commits
   - Any other file system operations

**Example workflow:**
```
Claude: "I will add a new function to AlarmManager.swift to handle snooze functionality. This involves adding a snooze() method and updating the alarm state management. Do you approve?"

User: "yes"

Claude: [Proceeds with the approved changes]
```

**No exceptions** - Every change requires prior explanation and approval.

## 🔍 MANDATORY: Always Ask for Review

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: Before making ANY modifications to this codebase, Claude MUST:

1. **Stop and ask for review** - Never proceed directly with changes
2. **Explain the planned changes clearly** - What files will be modified and why
3. **Wait for explicit "yes" or approval** - Do not assume permission
4. **Apply to every single change** - No matter how small or obvious it seems

**This applies to:**
- All code modifications
- File creation or deletion
- Configuration updates
- Documentation changes
- Git operations
- Any file system operations

**Remember**: The user wants to review and approve every change before it happens.

## Build and Development Commands

```bash
# Open project in Xcode
open "Mr Sleep.xcodeproj"

# Build for iOS Simulator using Xcode
~/Desktop/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild -project "Mr Sleep.xcodeproj" -scheme "Mr Sleep" -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15" build

# Build for device
~/Desktop/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild -project "Mr Sleep.xcodeproj" -scheme "Mr Sleep" -destination "generic/platform=iOS" build
```

## Xcode Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: Always use the desktop Xcode installation:
- **Correct Xcode Path**: `~/Desktop/Xcode.app` 
- **DO NOT use**: `~/Desktop/Xcode-beta.app` (no longer available)
- **xcodebuild Path**: `~/Desktop/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild`

All build commands should use the full path to the desktop Xcode.app installation to ensure compatibility and avoid conflicts with multiple Xcode versions.

## Architecture

### Framework and Dependencies
- **Pure SwiftUI** application with SwiftUI App lifecycle
- **No external dependencies** - uses only SwiftUI and Foundation
- **iOS 18.0+ minimum**, iPhone-only target
- **Bundle ID**: `com.magdoub.Mr-Sleeper`

### Core Architecture Pattern
- **MVVM-like structure** with singleton business logic
- **SleepCalculator.shared** - Singleton containing all sleep calculation logic
- **SleepNowView** - Main sleep calculation UI with embedded supporting components
- **State-driven UI** using SwiftUI `@State` properties extensively

### Key Components
- `Mr_SleepApp.swift` - App entry point with dark mode configuration
- `MainTabView.swift` - Tab bar container managing app navigation
- `SleepNowView.swift` - Main sleep calculation UI with onboarding and supporting views
- `AlarmsView.swift` - Alarm management with native iOS Clock app experience
- `SettingsView.swift` - User preferences and app configuration
- `AlarmManager.swift` - Alarm data storage and UI management  
- `SleepCalculator.swift` - Business logic singleton for sleep calculations
- `WakeUpTimeButton.swift` - Reusable button component for time display
- `SleepGuideView.swift` - Educational overlay about sleep hygiene
- `AlarmDismissalView.swift` - UI component for alarm dismissal
- `BackgroundAlarmManager.swift` - Background audio and timer management

### Business Logic
- **Sleep cycles**: 90 minutes each (3-8 cycles supported)
- **Fall asleep buffer**: 15 minutes automatically added
- **Recommended sleep**: 4.5-6 hours highlighted as optimal
- **Real-time updates**: Timer publishes minute-level updates to UI
- **Alarm creation**: One-tap alarm creation from sleep calculations
- **Alarm data management**: Create, edit, delete, toggle alarms
- **Sound selection**: Multiple alarm tones with preview functionality

## Code Patterns and Conventions

### SwiftUI Patterns
- Extensive use of `@State` for local UI state management
- `Timer.publish` for real-time clock updates
- LazyVGrid for efficient layout of time buttons
- Conditional rendering with SwiftUI's declarative syntax

### Styling Approach
- Custom dark blue gradient theme throughout
- Rounded corners and consistent spacing
- Grid-based layouts (2x2 for main times, 3-column for additional)
- Smooth animations and transitions

### State Management
- All UI state lives in ContentView as `@State` properties
- Business logic centralized in SleepCalculator singleton
- No external state management frameworks used

## Testing

**No testing infrastructure currently exists**. To add tests:
- Create new test targets in Xcode
- Focus unit tests on SleepCalculator logic
- Consider UI tests for core user flows

## Git Workflow

### Repository Information
- **Git Repository Location**: `/Users/magdoub/Documents/iOS projects/Mr Sleep/Mr Sleep/.git` (CONFIRMED: Git repo exists)
- **Working Directory for Git Commands**: `/Users/magdoub/Documents/iOS projects/Mr Sleep/Mr Sleep`
- **Remote Repository**: https://github.com/Magdoub/Mr-Sleep
- **Manual Commits**: Claude Code only commits when explicitly requested by user

### Commit Strategy
- **ONLY COMMIT WHEN EXPLICITLY REQUESTED**: Do not commit changes automatically
- **WAIT FOR USER INSTRUCTION**: Only create git commits when the user specifically asks for it
- **MANDATORY**: When committing, create clear, descriptive commit messages
- Commit messages should explain what was changed and why
- Include Claude Code attribution in all commit messages when committing
- Use present tense and imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature X", "Fix bug in Y", "Update Z configuration")

#### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Keep Commit Messages Short
**To avoid terminal hanging issues, prefer SHORT commit messages:**
- ✅ GOOD: `"Add alarm navigation feature"`
- ✅ GOOD: `"Fix popup dismiss behavior"`
- ✅ GOOD: `"Update tab navigation flow"`
- ❌ AVOID: Multi-line messages with bullets and special characters
- ❌ AVOID: Very long descriptions that cause terminal to hang

#### Commit Frequency Rules
1. **Only commit when user requests it** - no automatic commits
2. **Wait for explicit instruction** before creating any commits
3. **Group related changes** logically when committing
4. **Each commit should be meaningful** and well-described
5. **Commits are user-controlled** - never commit without permission

#### Pre-Commit Checklist
- [ ] All changes are tested and working
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Commit message follows the format above
- [ ] No temporary files or debug code left behind
- [ ] Changes are logically grouped in the commit

#### Post-Commit Actions
- Push commits to remote repository immediately
- Update any related issues or pull requests
- Document any breaking changes in commit body

- **Educational sleep guide** overlay with sleep hygiene tips
- **Categorized wake-up times** (Quick Boost, Recovery, Full Recharge)
- **3D icon assets** with rotating moon icons
- **Custom gradient backgrounds** and smooth animations
- **Read-only wake-up times**: Sleep calculations display only, no direct alarm creation
- **Complete alarm management**: Create, edit, delete, toggle alarms manually in Alarms tab
- **Sound preview**: Play alarm sounds when selecting them in the UI
