# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Mr Sleep is a pure SwiftUI iOS app that calculates optimal wake-up times based on sleep cycle science. The app uses 90-minute sleep cycles and accounts for 15 minutes to fall asleep.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è AUTO-APPROVAL MODE ENABLED

**CURRENT WORKFLOW**: Claude can make changes automatically without prior approval.

**AUTO-APPROVED OPERATIONS** - All operations can proceed without explicit approval:
   - Code modifications
   - File creation/deletion
   - Configuration changes
   - Documentation updates
   - Git commits
   - Bash commands
   - Any other file system operations

**Working Mode:** Claude will explain what was done after making changes, rather than asking for permission beforehand.

## üîç AUTO-APPROVAL: Review After Changes

**CURRENT MODE**: Claude makes changes first, then explains what was done.

1. **Proceed with changes immediately** - Make necessary modifications without waiting
2. **Explain changes clearly after completion** - Describe what was modified and why
3. **Apply to all operations** - All changes are auto-approved

**This applies to:**
- All code modifications
- File creation or deletion
- Configuration updates
- Documentation changes
- Git operations
- Any file system operations
- Bash commands

**Remember**: User has enabled auto-approval for all operations.

## Build and Development Commands

```bash
# Open project in Xcode
open "Mr Sleep.xcodeproj"

# Build for physical device (iPhone 3)
~/Desktop/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild -project "Mr Sleep.xcodeproj" -scheme "Mr Sleep" -destination "name=iPhone (3)" build
```

## Xcode Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: Always use the desktop Xcode installation:
- **Xcode Path**: `~/Desktop/Xcode.app` 
- **xcodebuild Path**: `~/Desktop/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild`

All build commands should use the full path to the desktop Xcode.app installation to ensure compatibility and avoid conflicts with multiple Xcode versions.

## Architecture

### Framework and Dependencies
- **Pure SwiftUI** application with SwiftUI App lifecycle
- **AlarmKit framework** integration for real alarm scheduling and notifications
- **iOS 26.0+ minimum**, iPhone-only target
- **Bundle ID**: `com.magdoub.Mr-Sleeper`

### Core Architecture Pattern
- **MVVM-like structure** with singleton business logic
- **SleepCalculator.shared** - Singleton containing all sleep calculation logic
- **SleepNowView** - Main sleep calculation UI with embedded supporting components
- **State-driven UI** using SwiftUI `@State` properties extensively

### Key Components
- `Mr_SleepApp.swift` - App entry point with dark mode configuration
- `MainTabView.swift` - 5-tab navigation container managing app navigation
- `SleepNowView.swift` - Main sleep calculation UI with onboarding and supporting views
- `SingleAlarmView.swift` - Dedicated single alarm experience with AlarmKit integration
- `AlarmKitView.swift` - AlarmKit alarm management with full CRUD operations
- `AlarmKitViewModel.swift` - AlarmKit integration layer and alarm scheduling
- `SettingsView.swift` - User preferences and app configuration
- `SleepCalculator.swift` - Business logic singleton for sleep calculations
- `WakeUpTimeButton.swift` - Reusable button component for time display
- `SleepGuideView.swift` - Educational overlay about sleep hygiene

### Business Logic
- **Sleep cycles**: 90 minutes each (1-6 cycles supported)
- **Fall asleep buffer**: 15 minutes automatically added
- **Smart category ordering**: Time-based priority (7PM-6AM: Full Recharge first, 6AM-7PM: Quick Boost first)
- **Recommended sleep**: 4.5-6 hours highlighted as optimal
- **Real-time updates**: Timer publishes minute-level updates to UI
- **AlarmKit integration**: Real alarm scheduling with iOS notifications
- **Alarm ID tracking**: UUID-based reliable alarm creation and deletion
- **Alarm data management**: Create, edit, delete, toggle alarms with AlarmKit
- **Sound selection**: Multiple alarm tones with preview functionality
- **Enhanced UX**: Selection-based controls, haptic feedback, and optimized loading animations

## Code Patterns and Conventions

### SwiftUI Patterns
- Extensive use of `@State` for local UI state management
- `Timer.publish` for real-time clock updates
- LazyVGrid for efficient layout of time buttons
- Conditional rendering with SwiftUI's declarative syntax

### Styling Approach
- Custom dark blue gradient theme throughout
- Rounded corners and consistent spacing
- Grid-based layouts (2x2 for main times, 3-column for additional)
- Smooth animations and transitions

### State Management
- All UI state lives in SleepNowView as `@State` properties
- Business logic centralized in SleepCalculator singleton
- No external state management frameworks used

## Testing

**No testing infrastructure currently exists**. To add tests:
- Create new test targets in Xcode
- Focus unit tests on SleepCalculator logic
- Consider UI tests for core user flows

## Git Workflow

### Repository Information
- **Git Repository Location**: `/Users/magdoub/Documents/iOS projects/Mr Sleep/.git` (CONFIRMED: Git repo exists)
- **Working Directory for Git Commands**: `/Users/magdoub/Documents/iOS projects/Mr Sleep`
- **Remote Repository**: https://github.com/Magdoub/Mr-Sleep
- **Manual Commits**: Claude Code only commits when explicitly requested by user

### Commit Strategy
- **ONLY COMMIT WHEN EXPLICITLY REQUESTED**: Do not commit changes automatically
- **WAIT FOR USER INSTRUCTION**: Only create git commits when the user specifically asks for it
- **MANDATORY**: When committing, create clear, descriptive commit messages
- Commit messages should explain what was changed and why
- Include Claude Code attribution in all commit messages when committing
- Use present tense and imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature X", "Fix bug in Y", "Update Z configuration")

## Version History

### Version 4.2 (Current) - Smooth Alarm Setup & Permission Flow

**‚ú® Alarm Setup Loading State & Authorization Fix (October 2025):**
- ‚úÖ **Smooth alarm setup loading**: Beautiful loading animation during alarm creation with "Setting up your alarm..." message
- ‚úÖ **Success animation**: "Alarm set!" confirmation with haptic feedback and green checkmark before transitioning to active alarm
- ‚úÖ **Fixed authorization flow**: Proper async permission handling that waits for user response to system popup
- ‚úÖ **Consistent permission denial UX**: Shows settings sheet on first-time denial (matches returning user experience)
- ‚úÖ **Loading phases**: Two-phase loading (loading ‚Üí success) with smooth animations and transitions
- ‚úÖ **No more UI glitches**: Loading state stays visible during permission request, prevents jarring "flash to main page"
- ‚úÖ **State pollution fix**: Authorization request happens BEFORE ViewModel initialization to prevent premature state changes

**üîß Technical Implementation:**
- **AlarmSetupLoadingView**: New loading component with rotating ring, pulsing alarm bell icon, animated dots, and success checkmark
- **AlarmSetupPhase enum**: Tracks loading phases (`.loading` and `.success`) for proper animation sequencing
- **SingleAlarmState.settingUpAlarm**: New state case for loading during alarm setup
- **Authorization order fix**: `checkAuthorization()` called BEFORE `viewModelContainer.initializeIfNeeded()` to prevent state pollution
- **Consistent denial handling**: Both first-time and returning users see permission sheet when permission denied
- **Accessibility support**: All animations respect `reduceMotion` accessibility setting

### Version 4.1 - Enhanced UX and Smart Priority System
